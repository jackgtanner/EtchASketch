My version of the Etch-A-Sketch project which is part of the Odin Project's learning course.

The user is presented with a 16x16 grid.
Each cell turns grey when moused over, acting like an Etch-A-Sketch.
The reset button is then used to reset the grid.
While the user is also prompted to choose the dimensions of the new grid. The container stays the same size, so they are choosing the 'resolution'.

Maximum size for the grid was chosen to not allow the browser to take too long to compute
